# GPXmagic v3.0.7 (ccc3dded)

## In this release ...

* We have gone back to the previous style of Profile view but with the gradient below.
* x1, x2, x4, x8 choice for vertical emphasis on Profile view.
* Most previews appear in Profile view, as circles (likely to improve).
* Open tools jump to the top of their docking zone.
* Overlay on Profile show current point location (metric only for now).
* Choice of map styles, but switching styles loses the terrain.

## Coming up, not necessarily in order ...

1. Loops (inc. impact on Bezier & Centroid)
2. Intersection and loop detection
3. Split and Join
4. Graph Theory (rework)
5. More altitude & gradient smoothing options
