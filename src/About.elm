# GPXmagic v3.0.3 (67c86613)

In this release:

* Radius bend preview removed when track is changed.
* Orange and Purple pointers are reset when track is changed.
* Radiused bends sometimes got the bend direction wrong.
* First-person "Rider view" added.
* Fetch elevations from map has transitioned. Caveats about accuracy apply.
* SVG file loading transitioned.

Thanks to all for feedback and suggestions. I'm working my way through the migration
of tools from v2, which is sometimes straightforward, sometimes not, so progress
is uneven.
