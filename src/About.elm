# GPXmagic v3.0.9 (d76f6508)

## In this release ...

* Layout is simplified. Only one tool dock on each side and no naming of docks.
This is in response to user feedback, should provide flexibility without intimidation.

* _Pointers_ and _Undo Redo_ are merged into _Essentials_. This cannot be closed.

* New _Tool Settings_ at bottom of dock, allows quick access to tool positioning and
provides ability to hide tools (and get them back). Will provide information on each
tool when I get round to writing it.

* Tool docks scroll vertically if there are more expanded than will fit in the window.

## Coming up, not necessarily in order ...

1. Graph theory
2. Terrain
3. French

## Legal guff
