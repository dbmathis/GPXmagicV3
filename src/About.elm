Thank you for testing **GPXmagic v3**. It's very much the same but with a
new core engine, and a new "pro" look and feel.

The main drivers here are speed, stability, and customisation.
In other words, it should be (mostly) faster, handle more complex routes, and
make it easier for you to organise tools your way.

There are some new tools in the pipeline but the priority is to migrate most
of the existing tools, maybe fixing some bugs in the process.

**Please** do not post problems on FaceBook; it's impossible to keep track. It's better
(for now) if you email me peter@stepwiserefinement.co.uk.

if you have a GitHub account, you can also post issues, see current issues, and ask questions at
https://github.com/peterjamesward/GPXmagicV3/issues

# GPXmagic v3.0.2 (67c86613)

If v1 was the surprise indie hit, v2 the disappointing second album, here's hoping
v3 is the polished studio album that delivers the goods.

In this release:

* The Return/Enter key will apply your new name to a tool docking zone.
* The Return/Enter key in the filename box will also save the GPX file.
* Some controls will now have tooltips that appear as you move the mouse over them.
* Move and Rotate has transitioned from v2, but without "fetch elevations from map".

Thanks to all for feedback and suggestions. I'm working my way through the migration
of tools from v2, which is sometimes straightforward, sometimes not, so progress
is uneven.
