Thank you for testing GPXmagic v3. It's very much the same but with a
new core engine, and a new look and feel.

The main drivers here are speed (especially on longer routes) and customisation.
In other words, it should be (mostly) faster, handle more complex routes and
make it easier for you to organise the way you like it.

There are some new tools in the pipeline but the priority is to migrate most
of the existing tools, maybe fixing some bugs in the process.

PLEASE do not post problems on FaceBook; it's impossible to keep track.

PLEASE post issues and ask questions at https://github.com/peterjamesward/GPXmagicV3/issues
where you can see if your issue is already known, and see when (if) they are fixed.
