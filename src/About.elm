Thank you for testing **GPXmagic v3**. It's very much the same but with a
new core engine, and a new "pro" look and feel.

The main drivers here are speed, stability, and customisation.
In other words, it should be (mostly) faster, handle more complex routes, and
make it easier for you to organise tools your way.

There are some new tools in the pipeline but the priority is to migrate most
of the existing tools, maybe fixing some bugs in the process.

**Please** do not post problems on FaceBook; it's impossible to keep track. It's better
(for now) if you email me peter@stepwiserefinement.co.uk.

if you have a GitHub account, you can also post issues, see current issues, and ask questions at
https://github.com/peterjamesward/GPXmagicV3/issues
