Thank you for testing **GPXmagic v3**. It's very much the same but with a
new core engine, and a new "pro" look and feel.

The main drivers here are speed, stability, and customisation.
In other words, it should be (mostly) faster, handle more complex routes, and
make it easier for you to organise tools your way.

There are some new tools in the pipeline but the priority is to migrate most
of the existing tools, maybe fixing some bugs in the process.

**Please** do not post problems on FaceBook; it's impossible to keep track. It's better
(for now) if you email me peter@stepwiserefinement.co.uk.

if you have a GitHub account, you can also post issues, see current issues, and ask questions at
https://github.com/peterjamesward/GPXmagicV3/issues

# GPXmagic v3.0.1 (2679ce48)

If v1 was the surprise indie hit, v2 the disappointing second album, here's hoping
v3 is the polished studio album that delivers the goods.

In this release:

* Editable labels on the tool docking zones, so you can make it more yours.
* A clean and efficient implementation of Limit Gradients.
* Limit Gradients shows a preview on the Profile Charts, with zoom and pan.

Thanks to all for feedback and suggestions. I'm working my way through the migration
of tools from v2, which is sometimes straightforward, sometimes not, so progress
is uneven.
